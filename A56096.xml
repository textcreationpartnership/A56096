            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <p>Upon the said 17th. of <hi>November,</hi> the Bells began generally to ring about three a Clock in the morning, in the City of <hi>London;</hi> and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Honourable and Worthy Gentlemen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the <hi>Temple,</hi> as well as the City (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membering the burning both of <hi>London</hi> and the Temple which was apparently Executed by <hi>Popish</hi> Villany) were pleased to be at the charge of an Extraordinary Triumph, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration of that Blessed <hi>Protestant</hi> Queen, which was managed in the manner following.</p>
               <p>In the evening of the said day, all things being prepared, the <hi>Solemn Procession</hi> began setting out from <hi>Moregate,</hi> and so proceeded to <hi>Bishops-gate-street,</hi> and down <hi>Hounsditch</hi> to <hi>Aldgate,</hi> and from thence through <hi>Leaden-hall-street, Corn-hill</hi> by the <hi>Royall Exchange,</hi> through <hi>Cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side</hi> to <hi>Temple-bar</hi> in the Order following.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:49027:10"/>1. First marched six Whifflers in Pioneers caps and red wastcoats. 2. A Bellman ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Bell, and with a loud and dolesome voice, crying all the way, <hi>Remember Justice</hi> Godfrey. 3. A dead Body representing Justice <hi>Godfrey</hi> in the habit he usually wore, and the <hi>Crevat</hi> wherewith he was murdered about his neck, with spots of Blood on his Wrists, Breasts and Shirt, and white Gloves on his hands, his face pale and wan, riding upon a white Horse and one of his Murderers behind him to keep him from falling, in the same manner as he was carried to <hi>Primrose-hill.</hi> 4. A Priest came next in a Surplice, and a Cope Imbroidered with Dead mens <hi>Sculls</hi> and Bones, and <hi>Skeletons,</hi> who gave out pardons very plentifully to all who would murder <hi>Protestants,</hi> and proclaiming it <hi>Meritorious.</hi> 5. A Priest alone with a large silver cross. 6. Four <hi>Carmelite Fryers</hi> in white and black Habits. 7. Four <hi>Grey Friars</hi> in their proper Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits. 8. Then six <hi>Jesuits</hi> carrying bloody Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers 9. Four wind Musick called the <hi>Waits</hi> play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing solemnly all the way. 10. Four <hi>Bishops</hi> in Purple, with Lawn sleeves, and <hi>Golden Crosses</hi> on their breasts, and <hi>Crosier staves</hi> in their hands.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49027:11"/> 11. Four other Bishops in their <hi>Pontificalibus,</hi> with Surplices and Rich Imbroydered Copes, and Golden Miters on their Heads. 12. Six Cardinals in Scarlet Robes and Caps. 13. Then followed the Popes Chief Physician with <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits</hi> powder in one hand, and an Urinal in the other. 14. Two Priests in Surplices with two Golden Crosses. Lastly, The <hi>Pope</hi> in a lofty Glorious Pageant, representing a Chair of State, covered with Scarlet, the Chair being richly Embroidered and Fringed, and be deckt with Golden Balls and Crosses; At his Feet was a Cushion of State, and two Boys sate on each side the Pope, in Surplices with white silk Banners, painted with red Crosses, and bloody Consecrated Daggers for murdering <hi>Protestant</hi> Kings and Princes, with an Incense Pot before them Censing his Holiness. The <hi>Pope</hi> was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayed in a Rich Scarlet Gown, lined through with Ermins, and adorned with Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Lace, with a <hi>Tripple Crown</hi> on his Head, and a Glorious Collar of Gold and precious stones about his neck, and St <hi>Peters Keys,</hi> a great quantity of <hi>Beads, Agnus Dei's,</hi> and other <hi>Catholick</hi> Trumpery about him. At his Back
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49027:11"/> stood the Devil, <hi>His Holinesses</hi> Privy Councellor, frequently Caressing, Hugging and VVhisper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him all the way, and oftentimes instructing him aloud to destroy His Majesty, to contrive a pretended <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Plot, and to <hi>fire the City</hi> again, to which purpose he held an <hi>Infernal Torch</hi> in his hand; The whole Procession was attended with an Hundred and Fifty Torches and Flambaus by order, but there were so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more who came in Voluntiers, as made the number to be several Thousands. Never were the Balconies, VVindows and Houses more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merously filled, nor the Streets more thronged with multitudes of people, all Expressing their Abhorrence of Popery with continual Shouts and Acclamations, so that in the whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress of their Procession, by a modest compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation it is judged there could not be less then two hundred thousand Spectators.</p>
               <p>Thus with a slow and solemn state in some hours they arrived at <hi>Temple-bar,</hi> where all the Houses seemed to be converted into Heaps of Men, VVomen and Children, who were divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Variety of Excellent Fireworks: It is known that <hi>Temple-bar</hi> since its Rebuilding is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49027:12"/> with four stately Statues of Stone, two on each side the Gate, Those toward the City Representing Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and King <hi>James,</hi> and the other two toward the <hi>Strand,</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> the first, and our present Gracious So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign; Now in regard of the day, the Statue of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was adorned with a Crown of gilded Lawrel on her Head, and in her hand a Golden shield with this Mottoinscribed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>The Protestant Religion, Magna Charta;</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral lighted Torches were placed before her, and the Pope being brought up near the Gate, the Song following was sung in Parts, between one who represented the <hi>English</hi> Cardinal <hi>Howard,</hi> and another the People of <hi>England.</hi>

Year of her most happy Reign, and in the Year of our Lord 1588. When he Designed no less than the utter Conquest and Ruin of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which was occasioned by the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Ambition of <hi>Spain,</hi> the Instiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Pope and some Traiterous <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> Fugitives. The Arguments which In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them to it were, That the Church
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:49027:41"/> of God could not be more Gloriously and Meritoriously Propagated, then by Conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>England,</hi> and thereby Extirpating and Destroying <hi>Heresie,</hi> and setting up the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholick Religion</hi> therein; that the Queen of <hi>England</hi> was an <hi>Heretick,</hi> and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated by the Pope, and continued Contumacious to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and was therefore by all Ways and Means to be taken away and destroyed.</p>
               <p>And to execute this Glorious and Blessed Enterprize, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> prepared a Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Navy of One Hundred and Thirty tall Ships, containing Fifty Seven Thousand Eight Hundred and Eight Tun, wherein were Eight Thousand Six Hundred Mariners, Nineteen Thousand and Ninety Five Souldiers, and Two Thousand Ninety Eight Gally-Slaves. The Duke of <hi>Parma▪</hi> likewise designed to bring Fifty Thousand Souldiers more out of <hi>Flanders</hi> to joyn with them They had also aboard Two thousand six hundred and thirty great Ordinance, with Boats and Tenders, and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:49027:41"/> all sorts of Provision whatsoever, not forgetting to bring also Chains, Whips, and Butcherly Knives, to Enslave, Torment, and Murther the poor <hi>English Protestants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Mighty Fleet was full five Years in preparing, and was so exceeding powerful, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> themselves were even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed at it, and procured the Pope to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten it, <hi>The Invincible Armado;</hi> he himself likewise Contributing a Million of Gold to so Pious and Religious a Design; and thus with the Popes Blessing, and the Prayers of the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> to God and the Saints for their good Success, this Dreadful Navy sailed slowly towards the English Shoar (the Ocean seeming to groan with its Burthen) which they brought into the form of an <hi>Ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in the mean time was not idle, but in the first place com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a Fast to be kept, requiring all her
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:49027:42"/> Subjects to make humble Supplications to God for Success and Deliverance from this Imminent danger; yet knowing that Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers without Endeavours, are like <hi>Rachel, Beautiful but Barren,</hi> she with all speed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides a double Guard, ordering the Trained Bands of the Counties to be raised for a Land Guard, and as good a Fleet as possible, consisting of One hundred and forty Ships, divided into three Squadrons, commanded by the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> Admiral, Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> Vice Admiral, and the Lord <hi>Henry Seymour</hi> Rear Admiral. When this Mighty Moving Wood of <hi>Spain</hi> was entred the <hi>Brittish</hi> Seas, and found the Queen so well prepared, contrary to their Expectation, they resolved rather to make a Chase Fight than lie by it. The Queen commanded the Lord Admiral to make ready Eight of her worst Ships and to fill them with Wild Fire, Pitch, Rosin, Brimstone, and other Combusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Matter, which were sent before the Wind and Tide in the Dead of the Night into the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:49027:42"/> midst of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Fleet, and the Trains taking Fire, made such a Dreadful Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, that the Affrighted <hi>Spaniards</hi> th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">

                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing them to be deadly Inventions, raised a sad Outcry, and hastily cut their Cables, and in the greatest Fear and Confusion fell foul one upon another, whereupon the Queens Fleet under <hi>Drake</hi> and other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, sunk and took many of them, and drove others upon the Sands; so that of One hundred thirty four Ships that set sail out of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> only thirty three returned. In short, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> lost in this Voyage, Eighty one Ships, and Thirteen thousand five hundred and odd Souldiers, and above Two thousand Prisoners taken in <hi>England, Ireland,</hi> and the <hi>Low-Countries.</hi> And thus this Mighty Design came to nought, and the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty was wonderfully pleased to deliver these <hi>Protestant Kingdoms</hi> from <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Slavery,</hi> and let us beseech God to continue this Blessing to us and our Posterity for ever.</p>

                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:49027:44"/> and <hi>Protestants,</hi> all at one Blast. To which end the Conspirators took Lodgings near the Parliament House, and then all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirators took an Oath of Secrecy in these words: <hi>You shall Swear by the blessed Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and by the Sacrament you now purpose to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, never to Disclose, directly or indirectly, by Word or Circumstance, the matter that shall be proposed to you to keep secret; nor desist from the Execution till the rest shall give you leave.</hi> And now the business went on apace, and all things being ready, the Fifth of <hi>November</hi> was the day designed for the Execution, but about ten days before, a Letter directed to the Lord <hi>Montegle</hi> was delivered by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known person to his Foot man in the Street, with a strict charge to give it into his Lords own hand, which accordingly he did, and the Lord being troubled at the Contents, presently imparted it to the Secretary of State, who soon presented it King <hi>James;</hi> which was in these words:</p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:49027:44"/>
               <q>MY Lord, Out of Love to some of your Friends, I have a care of your preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; therefore I would advise you, as you tender your Life, to devise some excuse to shift off your Attendance at this Parliament, for God and Man have commanded to punish the Wickedness of this time, and think not slightly of this Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement, but retire your self into the Country, where you may expect the Event with safety; for though there be no appearance of any stir, yet I say they shall receive a terrible blow this Parliament and yet they shall not see who hurts them. This Cousel is not to be Contemned, because it may do you good, and can do you no harm, for the danger is past so soon as you have burnt the Letter; and I hope God will give you the Grace to make use of it: to whose Holy protection I commend you.</q>
               <p>The King reading this Letter, concluded it contained some extraordinary design, and that by the <hi>Blow</hi> was meant some Blast of Gunpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; And thereupon ordered strict search to be made under the <hi>Parliament House</hi> about Midnight, the Parliament being to sit next
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:49027:45"/> day. And at the Door of the Celler they found one <hi>Guy Faux,</hi> prepared and booted for a Journey; who being apprehended, a further search was made, and upon removing some Billets that were plac'd to prevent disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, they found the Serpents Nest filled with 36 Barrels of Gun-powder; and searching <hi>Faux,</hi> there was found about him a dark Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorn, three Matches, and other Instruments for firing the Powder: and thus was this hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Plot discovered, and we <hi>Protestants</hi> once again escaped from the Horrid Designs of the <hi>Papists,</hi> and the Conspirators received their deserved punishment.</p>

               <p>When their Plot was ready to be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they proceeded against the <hi>English</hi> in divers methods; some of the <hi>Irish Papists</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly stripping the <hi>Protestants,</hi> and turned them out of doors naked: Others murdering Man, Woman and Child without mercy.

                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:49027:46"/> Places: in some places killing the Cows and Sheep, only because they belonged to the <hi>English;</hi> and sometimes cut off their Legs, or a piece out of their buttocks, leaving them to live in pain.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Popish</hi> Priests gave their Sacrament, to several <hi>Irish,</hi> upon condition that they should spare neither Man, Woman nor Child of the Protestants; saying, <hi>That it did them a great deal of good to wash their hands in their blood.</hi> They also excommunicated all that should relieve, harbour, or give them Alms; so that many were starved and perished for want of Relief, and their Monks and Fryers exhorted them with tears in their Eyes not to spare any of the <hi>English.</hi> They boasted that when they had destroyed them in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> they would go into <hi>England,</hi> and would not leave the memory of an <hi>English</hi> Man under Heaven.

               <p>The <hi>Papists</hi> have since upon all occasions convinced the World of their Wolvish Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in seeking by all means to destroy the <hi>Protestants.</hi> As particularly, in the Year 1655. When their Cursed Priests and Jesuites stirred up the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> to fall upon his
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:49027:50"/> Innocent <hi>Protestant</hi> Subjects in the Vallies of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> whereby several Hundred In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Souls were basely murdered, of all Sexes, Ages and Degrees, with the greatest Cruelty and Variety of Torments that it was possible for bloody Malicious <hi>Papists</hi> to invent.</p>
               <p>And since that, in the Year 1656. they have acted the like Villanies upon the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants</hi> in <hi>Lithuania</hi> and <hi>Poland;</hi> wherein ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny had their Skins flead off, and pull'd over their Ears while they were alive; others their Hands and Feet cut off; some their Bowels taken out alive, some wounded in the Heads and Bodies, and melted Lead poured into their Wounds; others their Eyes boared out: and it was accounted a great favour if they had only their Heads cut off with Swords. <hi>How long, O Lord, Holy and True, ere thou avenge the Blood of thy Saints and Servants upon the Bloody Antichristian Beast of</hi> Rome.</p>

               <head>Brief Remarks upon the Wicked Lives of several Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ill Accidents that have happened to some of them.</head>
               <p>IN the time of Pope <hi>John</hi> the 23, there was a Council holden at <hi>Rome,</hi> where, when they were Sate, a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ugly Owl flew too and fro amongst them, making an hideous noise, and at last setled upon a Beam, and stared the Pope directly in the Face, which much troubled them all, and the Pope especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and looking upon it to be Ominous, he dismissed the Council for that time, and after a while they sate again, where the Owl without a Summons appeared again, and stared the Pope in the face as before, and would not be forced from
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:49027:97"/> the place where she sate with all the shouts and hallowings they could make, till with Clubs and Sticks thrown at her she fell down dead before them all.</p>
               <p>This <hi>John</hi> the 23 was made <hi>Pope</hi> by force, and not by choice; and was so no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious a Villain, that he was deposed by the Council of <hi>Constance</hi> upon seventy scandalous Articles, That he was a Liar, a <hi>Symonist,</hi> a Pagan, an Incarnate Devil, an Heretick that denied the Souls Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality and Eternal Life, he caused his Predecessor and his Physitian to be Poysoned; committed Incest with his Brothers wife, counted Whoredom and Adultery Venial Sins, and yet he was the Infallible head of the <hi>Papists</hi> Holy Church.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Thomas Bullen</hi> an <hi>Englishman,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sent Ambassador to the <hi>Pope,</hi> in the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:49027:98"/> time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight, kissed his Holiness Toe, which he had no sooner done, but his Spaniel in Imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Master, sought to do the like, but instead of a gentle salute, gave him a bite, enough to have made him been Cursed with Bell, Book, and Candle: Another Gentleman being admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Popes presence, had the honour to kiss his Toe, which his Servant tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing notice of, made all the hast possible out of the Room, but being stopt, and demanded the reason, he desired them to let him go, <hi>For if</hi> (said he) <hi>they make my Master, who is a man of so great an Estate to kiss his Toe, I am sure they will certainly make me, who am but his Servant, to kiss his Breech.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Pope <hi>John</hi> the Thirteenth was accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed for using Witchcraft and Magick;
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:49027:98"/> He came to the Popedome by Bribery, and was given up to all manner of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery, Perjury, and Sacriledge: He Dismembred divers of his Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, by plucking out their Eyes, cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off their Hands, and gelding them; He made Priests in his Stables among his Horses, and for Money made Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of Boys; he Ravished a Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, put out the Eyes of his Ghostly Father, brake Windows in the Night, set Houses on Fire, and drank a Health to the Devil; At last being taken in Adultery with another Mans wife, he received such a deadly wound from her Husband, as sent him, it is feared, not into Purgatory, but down-right into Hell.</p>
